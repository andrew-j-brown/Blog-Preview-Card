## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project gave me practice using fonts stored in an asset folder as opposed to linking to Google fonts. I also got to use some flexbox to arrange the card elements.

I really enjoyed setting up the card's box shadow to only update when the heading is hovered, rather than hovering anywhere on the card.

### Continued development

This is currently an unfinished project, as I still need to implement mobile scaling.

Will be updated upon completion.
